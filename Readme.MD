# 🧩 DevChallenges Collection

Welcome to my **DevChallenges.io** codebase!  
This repository is my central hub for all solutions, experiments, and projects completed through the [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io) platform — a hands-on way to sharpen real-world development skills through structured, design-driven challenges.

---

## 📘 Purpose

This repo isn’t just a storage space — it’s a **learning log**.  
Every folder represents progress through the DevChallenges curriculum, from early responsive layouts to more advanced full-stack builds. My aim is to:

- Practice **clean, reusable, and modern code**
- Recreate **real-world UI/UX designs**
- Document the **thought process** behind each build
- Track how my **approach to problem-solving** evolves over time

Each challenge includes design resources, starter code, and a community of developers to learn from and collaborate with.
